# Interests
- description: Long-Distane Running: I enjoy the discipline of marathon training, particularly chasing the exciting goal of becoming a Six World Marathon Majors Finisher.
- description: Travel and Language: Passionate about seeing the world and breaking down language barriers. I'm actively learning Spanish to ensure my next bagpacking in places like South America are full of authentic conversations and deeper experiences.
